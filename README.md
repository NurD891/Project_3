# Date Class in Java

## Project Overview
This project contains a simple `Date` class in Java that handles basic date operations like validation, updating, printing, and calculating differences between dates. The `Main` class demonstrates how to use the `Date` class with example dates.

## Additional Notes
- The `Date` class uses a simplified date validation and difference calculation for educational purposes.
- Dates are validated based on basic rules without accounting for leap years.
- The difference calculation assumes each month has 30 days and each year has 360 days.

## Challenges
- Understanding how to structure classes and methods in Java.
- Implementing basic date validation logic.
- Handling invalid dates gracefully with appropriate messages.
